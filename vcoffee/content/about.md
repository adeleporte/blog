Antoine and Jean-Bernard are always on the road to promote the VMware Network & Security Portofolio to customers.

When they finally have a chance to meet at the office, they take the opportunity to exchange ideas about networking, security, automation, cloud native apps, scripting…and plenty of other exciting technos…while having a coffee.

This blog shares some of these discussions.
